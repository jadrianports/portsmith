/**
 * `/auth/confirm` — email-confirmation + password-recovery token exchange (AUTH-02, AUTH-04, D-06).
 *
 * A single GET route handler the Supabase email templates point at. With the
 * built-in mailer + the `token_hash` template (configured in 02-02), the link
 * carries `?token_hash=…&type={email|recovery}` — so this handler uses
 * `verifyOtp({ type, token_hash })`, NEVER `exchangeCodeForSession` (Pitfall 2:
 * the latter is for the PKCE `?code=` flow, which this project does not use).
 * `verifyOtp` turns the single-use server-verified OTP into a real session by
 * writing the `@supabase/ssr` cookies through the awaited server client; the
 * Phase 1 middleware then refreshes that session on every subsequent request
 * (consumed, not rebuilt — AUTH-03).
 *
 * Routing (D-06):
 *   - `type === 'recovery'` → `/update-password` (Plan 05's recovery landing).
 *   - otherwise (email confirm) → the validated `next`, defaulting to `/dashboard`.
 *   - any failure (missing/invalid token, verifyOtp error) → `/login?error=auth`,
 *     a single generic redirect that NEVER leaks which token or type failed
 *     (Pitfall 3 / T-02-15).
 *
 * Security — open-redirect hardening (Security A5 / T-02-12 / WR-03): `next` is an
 * UNTRUSTED query parameter. It is constrained to an internal, same-origin,
 * absolute-path string (must start with a single `/`, must not start with `//`
 * or `/\`, and must not parse as an absolute URL). Anything else falls back to
 * `/dashboard`.
 *
 * The redirect is RELATIVE (WR-03): we emit the validated PATH as the `Location`
 * header (a 303 with a bare `/dashboard`-style value) and let the BROWSER resolve
 * it against the actual request origin. This is the fix for two compounding
 * problems the earlier absolute-URL form had:
 *   - it built the redirect origin from the untrusted `Host` header → a classic
 *     open-redirect (a request with `Host: attacker.example` bounced the
 *     just-authenticated user to `https://attacker.example/dashboard`);
 *   - but it COULD NOT simply adopt the server's normalized host either, because
 *     under `next dev` the confirm email lands on 127.0.0.1:3000 while the server
 *     normalizes to localhost:3000 — two DISTINCT cookie origins, so an absolute
 *     redirect to the normalized host would land the browser on a different origin
 *     than the one verifyOtp wrote the session cookie to (no session → bounce to
 *     /login).
 * A relative Location resolves against the origin the browser is ALREADY on (the
 * verifyOtp cookie's origin), so it neither trusts the Host header nor drops the
 * dev cookie. The token query is never carried forward (we emit only the path).
 *
 * NOTE on location: this handler lives at the BARE `/auth/confirm` path, NOT
 * inside the `(auth)` route group — the email-template URL must match this exact
 * path (the `(auth)` group segment is invisible in the URL, so its pages are
 * `/login`, `/signup`, … but the confirm handler must be a real `/auth/confirm`).

 * Phase 19; it is now emitted by a real runtime path (the change-email flow), so
 * it is allowed here — the single literal added (T-19-02). It needs NO new switch
 * case: an `email_change` success falls through the existing non-recovery branch
 * to the validated `next` (the template passes `next=/dashboard/settings`, a bare
 * internal path the safeInternalPath guard accepts), so the user lands back on
 * the settings page. Anything else (`signup`, `magiclink`, `invite`, or arbitrary
 * attacker input) is still a generic failure: we never pass an unvalidated string
 * into `verifyOtp`, and never route a non-`recovery` verified token through the
 * attacker-controlled `next`. Add a value here ONLY when a real runtime path emits
